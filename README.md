# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Backend Software Engineering
## Summary





A web service that accepts HTTP requests and return responses based on the conditions outlined in the section below.

- Users have points in their account from multiple payers
- Payers submit their transactions to add/subtract points from user.
All the transactions will be stored in memory on the backend.
Payer's total points cannot go negative.
- Users can spend their points.
Oldest points are spent first accordingly in their transaction's timestamp, regardless of payer.

## Technologies
**Tech Stack:**

- Python
- Flask
- Jinja2
- HTML
- Bootstrap (only used for readability of the routes)

## Features

Show all routes

![All Routes](README-img/all-routes.jpg)


Add Transactions
### POST Route "/add-transactions"
You can click directly on the nav bar on "add transactions" or type after the "/" add-transactions. We will be using the frontend to make the API calls.

Add Response:
The response will be delivered on the backend. Note that this web service does not use any durable data store. So when the server is started there's no data in the backend, which means that there will not be any payer transactions nor either points for the user.
